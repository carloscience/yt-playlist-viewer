A YouTube theater application that does the following:

* Authenticates with Google v3 api
* Shows the user's youtube playlists
* Shows list of videos in user's playlist and displays embedded video in a theater
* Adds video to playlist

This is a first draft at a theater application. There is virtually no design - I've been mainly concerened with application logic for phase 1. It needs UI design and error checking for invalid input. Currently, to add a video to a playlist, you have to enter a valid youtube video id. ex: me21QEpg760.
