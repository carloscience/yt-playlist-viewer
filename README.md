A YouTube theater application that does the following

1) Authenticates with Google v3 api
2) Shows the user's youtube playlists
3) Shows list of videos in user's playlist and displays embedded video
4) Adds video to playlist

This is a first draft at a theater application. There is virtually no design - I've been mainly concerened with application logic for phase 1. It needs UI design and error checking for invalid input. Currently, to add a video to a playlist, you have to enter a valid youtube video id. ex: me21QEpg760.
